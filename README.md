Retail data analysis

## Which script does what

- `process.py` classifies by subgroup (monthly cohort and clean or mixed history), makes a graph, and spits out datafiles
- `survivalcount.py` messes with how many orders a client places
- `timeseries.py` visualizes when orders are placed for clients with a number of orders exceeding a threshold
- `scatterplots.py` visualized indices brands/products, categories/brands, products/categories


## To-do list

- seasonal versus regular
- divide into cohorts based on how many products they bought in total
- purchase frequency 
- overall spending
